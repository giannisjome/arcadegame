=======
This project contains 3 folders , one index.html file and one readme file.
The **index.html** file contains the html code for this project.

The **css folder** contains the css code, which is used for styling the project.

The **js folder** contains three javascript files. 
* The **Resources.js** has an image loading utility. It eases the process of loading image files so that they can be used within your game. It also includes a simple "caching" layer so it will reuse cached images if you attempt to load the same image multiple times.
* The **Engine.js** which provides the game loop functionality (update entities and render), draws the initial game board on the screen, and then calls the update and render methods on  player and enemy objects (defined in  app.js).
* The **app.js** which includes the in-game functionality, like player and enemy movement, score, lives , etc.

## Run the project
To run the project, open the index.html file.

## How to play
Use the arrows keys and try to reach your player in the water!

**Be careful!!** Your player shouldn't collide with the enemies.
The enemies are the bugs which are running randomly in your screen.
If you collide three times with the enemies the game is over.
